# 6. Debugging

A good friend (Pedro Rodriguez) has written a very good tutorial on [how to debug machine learning code](https://www.pedro.ai/blog/2019/12/15/debug-ml-code/).
I strongly recommend that you read through his tutorial, as the tips there will save you a lot of future headaches.
In this section I'm not aiming to repeat much of what he's said, but instead complement it by explaining in depth how I use debugging tools while working with AllenNLP.
